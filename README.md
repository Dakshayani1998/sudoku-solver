Sudoku is a logic-based puzzle that uses combinatorial-number placement. In a classic Sudoku puzzle, the task is to fill the numbers in a 9 x 9 grid laced in such a way that each row, each column, and each of the sub-grid of the size 3 x 3 contains all the numbers from 1 to 9 (1 and 9 inclusive). Backtracking algorithm tries to solve the puzzle by testing each cell for a valid solution.If there’s no violation of constraints, the algorithm moves to the next cell, fills in all potential solutions and repeats all checks.If there’s a violation, then it increments the cell value. Once, the value of the cell reaches 9, and there is still violation then the algorithm moves back to the previous cell and increases the value of that cell
